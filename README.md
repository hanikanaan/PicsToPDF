# PicsToPDF
Python script to convert picture(s) to PDF file, made to further accomodate my online school experience as it made things easier for submission.

This was done using tkinter and Pillow

The .exe file was made using PyInstaller, and can be run on any Windows computer. The Python script can run on any computer that supports Python.
